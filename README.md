**About the company** :
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India.

Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.
As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.
