**About the company** :
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India.
They have been working in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years.
Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.
As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue.
 However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.
Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.


**Problem Statement** :
The revenue management team has provided sample data and a mock-up dashboard to the 3rd party data analyst and asked to provide insights from the historical data .

Key tasks which needs to be completed:-

Create the metrics according to the metric list.
Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.
